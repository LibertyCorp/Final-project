Arduino PID controller.


The devices general function was object retreival for physically impaired users when an item is dropped on the ground.

I used an arduino microcontroller to create closed loop positional control for two 12VDC motors paired with AS5600 magnetic encoders and a hobby servo.
This was my first arduino project. I was new to C/C++ when writing this, I was implementing the code as I learned it, so it has a lot of room for imporvement.
